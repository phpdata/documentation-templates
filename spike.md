# Spike

A Spike, also known as a `Proof of Concept` (POC), should have the following:

* Objective: Clear single objective
* Documentation: Results of Spike should be documented
  * What worked & why
  * What didnt work why
  * Assumptions
  * Not covered & why
* Review: Peer review that the objective has been achieved with a clear result
  * Code quality is NOT part of this review
* [optional] demo
* Code: should be in a branch & **never** merged in

*Note: This code is throw away, therefore it only needs to demostrate the `objective`*
