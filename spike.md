# Spike

A *Spike* is a *Story*, with the normal `story` attributes (estimateable, demonstrable, etc), and therefore fits into a *Sprint* just like other *Story*.

POC is one type of Spike. Spikes are there to remove uncertainty, such as doing part of a solution in order to be able to correctly estimate it (so it wouldn't necessarily be throwaway), or might be non-code (wireframes to explore UI options).

On completion of a Spike, a `Pull Request` should be created & then **closed** once reviewed (therefore kept). It should have the following information in the description:

| Objective | Single clear goal |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Type | POC (throw away) / Code / Research / Wireframe  |
| Exclusions | What is **NOT** included |
| Assumptions | ~ |
| Dependencies | ~ |
| Documentation | What worked, what didnt, why |
| Review | Pear review on Goal |
| Demo | success / failure |
